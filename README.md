# Binding Site Tensor
Contains scripts for an working project that converts protein binding sites to tensors for use in 3D CNN.

The keras code is written in CPU form, but was meant to be converted to GPU since the calculations are intensive. I currently only have MacOS, and this is the reason the project is currently on hold.
